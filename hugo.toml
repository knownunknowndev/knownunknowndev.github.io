description = "I'm Krishna Chaitanya Telikicherla. I work in security engineering, with a focus on penetration testing, leadership, and augmenting security engineers with AI. I also have a strong interest in systems thinking, metacognition, and chess. This site is where finished ideas and half-formed thinking coexist. The blog holds longer reflections. The garden holds notes, ideas, and things still forming."
